# KnowYourWord Chrome Extension

The WordMeaning Chrome Extension allows users to quickly look up the meaning of any word right from their browser. Simply enter a word into the extension's popup, and it will display the word's definition in an instant.

## How to Use

As the extension is not deployed on the Chrome Web Store yet, you can still use it by following these steps:

1. Download the zip file of the extension.
2. Unzip the downloaded file to access the extension folder.
3. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable the developer mode in the top right corner of the extensions page.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder you unzipped earlier.
6. Voila! The WordMeaning Chrome Extension is now installed and ready to use.
